          The Impossible Missions Force (IMF) is a top secret
          Intelligence gathering and direct action agency that
          specializes in the most difficult operations that must
          be dealt with by the United States. This Organization has
          on many occasions saved not just the United States, but the
          entire world from disaster. From recovering deadly biological
          agents from terrorist organizations to saving the world from
          destruction by nuclear attack, the IMF is the single most
          effective response to the most suffisticated and organized
          criminal element in the world.
          </p>

          <p>
          Here we pay tribute to the IMF and the brave men and women who
          risk life and freedom everyday to keep us safe. Some Agents of
          the IMF even continue their mission after having been betrayed
          by their own agency and country. We are in your eternal dept.

                <h3>Ethan Hunt</h3>
                <blockquote class="profile__details">
                  <p>
                  Ethan Matthew Hunt was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the
                  only child of Margaret Ethan and Nathan Hunt. Raised
                  on a dairy farm in Middle field, New York, he enlisted
                  in the Army right out of high school. Ethan enlisted
                  for the Infantry military occupational specialty and
                  decided that he would become an Army Ranger. After
                  graduating Basic, Advanced Individual, and Airborne
                  Training, Ethan was sent to the Ranger Indoctrination
                  Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the
                  3rd Battalion of 75th Ranger Regiment, under the
                  command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. He
                  then attended and passed Ranger School, where he
                  earned his Ranger Tab.  Ethan eventually fought in
                  combat during Operation Desert Storm.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  After four distinguished years in the Army, Ethan went
                  on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he
                  was a double major in Engineering and International
                  Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he
                  immediately sought employment with the Central
                  Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the
                  Agency, he had to go through background checks, take
                  the entrance exam, and go through a series of
                  interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the
                  entrance and psychological examinations, Ethan was
                  contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA
                  in a high-level position a few years before and he
                  believed Ethan would be perfect for a organization
                  outside of the Agency. In short order, he was
                  recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the
                  Impossible Mission Force.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Although he was initially only told that he would be
                  tasked with "unconventional black ops", Ethan
                  exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was
                  informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an
                  intensive operational training course to train him in
                  so-called "operational intelligence" or "trade-craft"
                  skills, including surveillance, clandestine
                  photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques.
                  He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical
                  high speed emergency driving, rappelling from
                  helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of
                  his military experience, Ethan excelled through
                  training.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Once he completed training, he was given the "cover
                  legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department
                  of Transportation and placed in a five person team
                  (called an "IM Force") as the team's point man. Led
                  by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job
                  was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical
                  intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and
                  neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a
                  trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence
                  organizations in that, once their orders have been
                  given, there are no required procedures for the
                  fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his
                  fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary
                  and success was all that matters. The downside was,
                  of course, obvious; if a team member was either
                  captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would
                  disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.

                <blockquote class="profile__details">
                  <p>
                  Luther John Stickell joined the Impossible Mission
                  Force (I.M.F.) at an unknown time (knowingly before
                  Hunt) and he was the agency's computer specialist.
                  Luther would later become an disavowed agent and
                  went into the shadows against his former employers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  After Ethan Hunt learned there was a mole in the IMF
                  and the N.O.C list was faked, he needed a team of
                  operatives off the grid to clear his name. Hunt
                  enlisted disavowed agents Luther and pilot Franz
                  Krieger alongside Jim Phelps' wife Claire.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Stickell is chosen as "Cyber-Ops" for his reputation
                  as a well-known hacker and phreaking. Reluctant at
                  first, Luther is baited into the hack when Ethan
                  played to Stickell's ego, selling the job proposal as
                  "The Mount Everest of hacks". Posing as a team of
                  firefighters putting out a small blaze within the
                  building, the rogue IMF team breaches the Central
                  Intelligence Agency and infiltrates the main computer
                  mainframe via a remote computer terminal at the CIA
                  Headquarters at Langley, Virginia. In order to gain
                  access to the floor with the N.O.C List, Luther hacks
                  into the building's computer-controlled electrical
                  system, triggering the fire alarm on that floor.

                  Benji, who was once a technician, aided Ethan Hunt
                  during the events of his wife, Julia Meade's
                  kidnapping. Ethan eventually rescues Julia with the
                  aid of Dunn. Benji was later promoted to a field agent
                  and helped break Hunt out of a Russian prison.
                  He aided Hunt on his next two missions to infiltrate
                  the Kremlin and then to retrieve nuclear launch codes
                  from Kurt Hendricks. During the attempt to bring a
                  broadcasting station back online, he realized that
                  William Brandt was taking too long and went after him,
                  leaving Jane Carter to finish the job as she was too
                  injured to go after Brandt. Dunn arrived in time to
                  kill Wistrom as he fought Brandt, allowing Brandt to
                  restore power to the station and Ethan to disable the
                  nuclear missile. Dunn later happily accepted another
                  mission from Ethan.

                  Ilsa's early life is unknown other than being born in
                  October 19th, 1983. She was trained by British Secret
                  Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, and became a
                  highly trained agent on the field. During her time as

                  Some point before 2015, she went undercover as a spy

                  operatives from around the globe recruited onto

                  <p>
                  Alan Hunley convinced Senate Committee to shut down
                  IMF because of its dangerous actions and fold its
                  assets into the CIA. Following the hearing, Hunley
                  questioned William Brandt on the whereabouts of Ethan
                  Hunt. Brandt claimed ignorance and stated that Hunt
                  was chasing a lead on the Syndicate. However, Hunley
                  stated that the CIA hadn't found proof of the
                  Syndicate's existence, believing it to be a fantasy
                  created by Ethan to justify the IMF's existence.
                  Deeming Ethan to be dangerous, Hunley organized a
                  manhunt for Ethan, only for the man to elude the CIA
                  for six months. Later, he interrogates Benji Dunn
                  about Ethan's whereabouts, but doesn't get any info.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Subsequently, Dunn goes to Vienna, where the Austrian
                  chancellor is killed by a car bomb. Hunley believed
                  Hunt and Dunn to be responsible and authorized the
                  CIA to shoot them on sight. After some time, Hunley
                  is called by Brandt, claiming that he wants to alert
                  him of a plot against the British Prime Minister.
                  Believing Ethan was targeting him, Hunley went to meet
                  directly with the Prime Minister and MI6 Chief Atlee.
                  When he tells the Prime Minister of Hunt's pursuit of
                  the Syndicate and his mission to unlock a digital red
                  box that only he has access to, the Prime Minister
                  expresses familiarity. He reveals that the Syndicate
                  was a classified proposed project to recruit foreign
                  operatives to perform missions without oversight and
                  realizes that Atlee created the Syndicate without his
                  approval.

                  Kurt Hendricks served in the Swedish Special Forces in
                  his youth. Hendricks became the Professor of Physics
                  at Stockholm University where he specialized in the
                  minutiae of the nuclear endgame theory. He was
                  regarded as a genius, with an IQ of 190. Despite this,
                  he was forced to resign by the university due to his
                  outlandish theories and claims of insanity. Following
                  this, Hendricks was affiliated with the Russian
                  Central Command during the Cold War, wherein his job
                  was to "predict the unthinkable". After twenty years
                  in his role as a nuclear strategist, Hendricks came up
                  with the concept of nuclear war in the place of
                  natural order after following the examples of
                  Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hendricks then worked in the
                  Kremlin as a nuclear strategist, wherein he formulated
                  a plan to steal a briefcase with nuclear launch codes
                  to facilitate his concept of world destruction.

                  Hendricks' plan was to ignite a nuclear conflict
                  between Russia and the United States. In order to
                  facilitate this, Hendricks arranged the destruction of
                  the Kremlin in Moscow in order to steal a nuclear
                  launch control-device while ultimately placing the
                  blame on the Impossible Mission Force. Hendricks also
                  later acquires the launch codes for the missile from
                  Sabine Moreau, whilst posing as his right-hand man
                  Marius Wistrom. His strategy for this conflict was to
                  ignite a global nuclear exchange and thus eliminate
                  most of the world's population. With most of the
                  world's people wiped out (and presumably their old
                  conflicts and hatreds along with them), a new era of
                  "peace" could be ushered in. Hendricks used the code
                  name; Cobalt, to prevent his true identity from
                  surfacing. After officially being disavowed because of
                  the Kremlin bombing, Ethan Hunt and his team
                  consisting of agents Jane Carter, Benji Dunn and Chief
                  Analyst, William Brandt, are tasked with stopping
                  Hendricks and bringing his conspiracy to light, or be
                  hunted down as terrorists responsible for the bombing.
                  Extremely resourceful, Hendricks made use of latex
                  masks to fool Hunt and his team into believing that
                  they were dealing with his right-hand man, eventually
                  escaped with the case that contains Russian nuclear
                  launch codes.

                  In 2006, Davian's illegal activities, including arms
                  trafficking, prompted IMF agent Lindsey Farris to
                  follow him. The man is considered a priority for the
                  IMF and he kidnaps Farris for three days in a factory
                  in Germany and places (or causes to be placed) a bomb
                  inside her head. Farris is rescued by Ethan Hunt and
                  his team from the IMF but Davian activates the bomb by
                  remote and it detonates before Ethan can deactivate
                  it, killing Farris.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Later in the film, the IMF's mission is to kidnap
                  Davian. So they go to Vatican City and while he's in
                  a bathroom, Davian is surprised to see another Davian
                  behind him. The latter is in fact Ethan Hunt and
                  Davian is overwhelmed by Hunt who obliges him to read
                  a text in order to have the voice of Davian for Ethan
                  to pass for him while his team kidnaps the arms
                  trafficker. Hunt sucks Davian and pretends to be
                  deceiving his bodyguard while Agent Declan Gormley
                  takes an unconscious Davian.

                  Hugh Stamp was born in the United Kingdom possibly in
                  1964 and he met former agent of Impossible Mission
                  Force, Sean Ambrose, and they became good friends.
                  After Sean left the IMF, he formed his own group with
                  Hugh as his right-hand man when Sean was getting
                  interested in Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich's newly genetic
                  virus, Chimera, and planned to sell the cure,
                  Bellorophon, to the highest bidder. Stamp speaks with
                  a South African accent suggesting that he might have
                  lived there for a protracted period of time.

                  After his former crew died, Ethan Hunt recruits two
                  disavowed Impossible Mission Force agents: computer
                  expert Luther Srtickell and pilot Franz Krieger. They
                  infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia,
                  steal the real list, and flee to London. Eugene
                  Kittridge detects the theft and has Hunt's mother and
                  uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking; he
                  provides wide media coverage of it, forcing Hunt to
                  call Kittridge. Hunt times the call to allow the CIA
                  to trace him to London before hanging up, but when he
                  is done, Hunt is surprised to find Phelps nearby.
                  Phelps recounts how he survived the shooting, naming
                  Kittridge as the mole who set them up in Prague.
                  Though he verbally agrees, Hunt realizes Phelps is the
                  mole and Max's "Job." Hunt also suspects Krieger had
                  killed the other IMF members on the Prague job after
                  recognising the distinctive knife he used on the
                  Langley mission as the same knife used to kill Sarah
                  Davies, but remains unsure whether Claire Phelps was
                  involved. Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list
                  aboard the TGV high-speed train to Paris the next day.

                <blockquote class="profile__details">
                  <p>
                  Phelps fought in the Korean War (at an unknown rank
                  in an unknown branch of the United States Armed
                  Forces) and worked (in an unknown job) for Pan
                  American Airlines before entering government service.
                  As a former government operative, Phelps formed the
                  Impossible Missions Force from a former elite Special
                  Forces squad led by Lieutenant Colonel-turned
                  Dr. Daniel David Briggs, Ph.D., late of Army
                  Intelligence. Eventually, Phelps took over Briggs'
                  position as the field leader for the core IMF team.

                  <p>
                  By 1996, Phelps has become disillusioned as he
                  believes he is no longer necessary, despite having
                  served his country for over four decades. By this
                  time, he has married a much younger woman named
                  Claire, and has been given an entirely new team.

                  Sean Ambrose was presumably born in the United Kingdom
                  as stated by his nationality. Later in his life, he
                  joined the Impossible Mission Force as a computer
                  specialist. During his IMF career, Swanbeck replaced
                  Ethan Hunt with Ambrose to face-double Hunt on field
                  missions when the latter could not be found. This
                  leads Ambrose to use an Ethan Hunt latex mask as his
                  main disguise in 2000.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  At around 2000, Ambrose became interested with
                  Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich's synthetic virus, Chimera,
                  and he wanted to sell its cure, Bellerophon, to the
                  highest bidder. Eventually, he left the IMF and began
                  to form his own group, with Hugh Stamp as his right-hand
                  man.
                  <p>

                  <p>
                  Prior to the events, Ambrose was in a relationship
                  with a highly capable professional thief, Nyah, and it
                  became close and sexual.[1] The relationship ended, as
                  Hugh stated that she "didn't gag for it" six months
                  ago. Swanbeck also notes that Ambrose has missed her,
                  wanting her back ever since.

                  William Brandt is an IMF agent, who was forced to work
                  with fellow IMF agent Ethan Hunt after the Secretary
                  of the Impossible Mission Force is killed. Brandt had
                  known of Hunt before their mission and had been
                  assigned a mission to protect Hunt and his former
                  wife, Julia Meade. During his mission one day, Brandt
                  followed Hunt for a run, leaving two agents to guard
                  her. He returned to find the agents unconscious and
                  Julia gone. Three days later, what was left of her
                  apparent body was found. Brandt aided Ethan to succeed
                  in his mission to retrieve nuclear launch codes from
                  Kurt Hendricks and accepted his next mission from
                  Ethan after it was revealed to him that Julia's death
                  had been faked by Ethan to protect her.

                  Julia Anne Meade-Hunt is the estranged wife of Ethan
                  Hunt. She did not know about her husband working for
                  Impossible Mission Force until after Ethan had to
                  rescue her from getting held hostage by Owen Davian.
                  Later, her death was faked in Croatia, as Ethan found
                  out that they had to be separated in order to keep
                  her safe.

                  Ethan met and fell in love with Julia while on a
                  "heli-boarding" trip at Lake Wanaka. To keep her from
                  finding out about his work with Impossible Mission
                  Force, he told her, as well as her friends and family
                  (the latter consisting of her siblings, Melissa and
                  Rick, and their widowed mother), that he studies
                  traffic patterns for the Virginia Department of
                  Transportation. Ethan and Julia married shortly before
                  he set off on a two-day "business trip", actually a
                  search for Owen Davian.

                  Lindsey Farris joined the IMF at an unknown time
                  (presumably early 2000s) and was trained by her mentor
                  and friend Ethan Hunt, who had retired from field
                  work. Hunt taught her the Filipino martial arts of
                  Eskrima in one flashback. Becoming a skilled agent,
                  she was given a mission in 2006 to investigate an arms
                  dealer named Owen Davian. Before being captured, she
                  mailed her mentor a postcard with information, telling
                  him that Theodore Brassel was working with Davian as a
                  mole, but John Musgrave is later revealed to be the
                  mole in Shanghai.

                  During a mission, she was captured by Owen Davian and
                  was implanted with a explosive charge in her head. IMF
                  agent Musgrave informs Hunt of her capture, and picked
                  his team members to rescue her, Declan Gormley, Zhen
                  Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell. Hunt rescues
                  Farris and two have to shoot their way through
                  Davian's henchman. Getting to the helicopter, Hunt
                  learns that Farris has a explosive charge in her head
                  that had just being activated, and tries to disarm it.
                  While trying to do so, the explosive charge detonated,
                  killing her instantly. Hunt, shocked and saddened,
                  tearfully holds his protégé. Farris was returned to
                  the IMF and later buried in an unknown location.

                  plane; Boeing 747, while disguising as Ethan Hunt, and
                  kills him and made his escape from the plane with his
                  right-hand man Hugh Stamp, along with two of his
                  operatives; Wallis and Ulrich with Nekhorvich's bag.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Later, Ethan is being informed by Seville-based IMF
                  chief, Swanbeck, that the Chimera virus is in
                  Ambrose's hands and the mission to recover it begins.
                  At a horse racing event, Ambrose meets John C. McCloy,
                  a British CEO of Biocyte, where Ethan and three
                  members of his team; computer specialist Luther
                  Stickell, British professional thief Nyah-Nordoff Hall
                  and Australian pilot William "Billy" Baird, gather
                  information on Biocyte and McCloy.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Conducting a raid on Biocyte's head office in Sydney,
                  Ethan destroys all but one Chimera sample and Ambrose
                  and his men engage Ethan in a firefight before
                  ordering Nyah to pass him the last Chimera injection
                  gun, but she injects herself with it. Ambrose lets
                  Nyah run wild to spread the virus as Ethan, disguising
                  as Hugh, gets the Bellorophon and Chimera before
                  escaping Biocyte's island complex to cure Nyah after
                  killing Ambrose for his crimes against humanity.

                  It's interesting - I used to have this professor at
                  Oxford, okay? Doctor Wickham, his name was and he
                  was, like, this massive fat guy, you know? Huge, big
                  guy. We used to call him - you know, well, I won't
                  tell you what we used to call him, but he taught
                  biomolecular kinetics and cellular dynamics. And he
                  used to sort of scare the underclassmen with this
                  story about how the world would eventually be
                  eviscerated by technology. You see, it was inevitable
                  that a compound would be created which he referred to
                  as the 'Anti-God'. It was like an **accelerated
                  mutator or sort of, you know, like a, an unstoppable
                  force of destructive power, that would just lay waste
                  to everything** - to buildings and parks and streets
                  and children and ice cream parlors, you know? So
                  whenever I see, like, a rogue organization willing to
                  spend this amount of money on a mystery tech, I
                  always assume...it's the Anti-God. End-of-the-world
                  kinda stuff, you know... [pauses, Ethan and Luther
                  gaze at him thoughtfully] But no, I don't have any
                  idea what it is. I was just speculating.

                  The technical description and requirements for a new
                  ballistic missile submarine were published in 1972.
                  Development of Project 667BDR was begun at the Rubin
                  Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering[3] under
                  the direction of main designer Sergeiy Nikiticz
                  Kovalev (Сергей Никитич Ковалёв). The submarine was
                  to be a successor to the project 667BD. The Delta
                  III-class subs are significantly quieter and have a
                  higher missile section for newer, longer-ranged
                  missiles.

                  A suitcase nuclear device (also suitcase bomb,
                  backpack nuke, mini-nuke and pocket nuke) is a
                  hypothetical tactical nuclear weapon that is portable
                  enough that it could use a suitcase as its delivery
                  method. Both the United States and the Soviet Union
                  developed nuclear weapons small enough to be portable
                  in specially-designed backpacks during the 1950s and
                  1960s.[1][2]
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  The maximum yield of the W54 warhead used in the
                  Special Atomic Demolition Munition (pictured) was 1kt
                  (1000 tonnes of TNT). This is actually larger and
                  heavier than the US W48 nuclear shell at 155mm (6.1
                  inches) in diameter and 846mm (33.3 inches) long and
                  weighing 53.5Kg (118lb) which represents the smallest
                  complete, self-contained physics package be fielded
                  and had a yield of 72 tonnes of TNT. Nuclear weapons
                  designer Ted Taylor has alleged that a 105mm (4.1
                  inch) diameter shell with a mass of 19Kg is
                  theoretically possible.
