          The Impossible Missions Force (IMF) is a top secret
          Intelligence gathering and direct action agency that
          specializes in the most difficult operations that must
          be dealt with by the United States. This Organization has
          on many occasions saved not just the United States, but the
          entire world from disaster. From recovering deadly biological
          agents from terrorist organizations to saving the world from
          destruction by nuclear attack, the IMF is the single most
          effective response to the most suffisticated and organized
          criminal element in the world.
          </p>

          <p>
          Here we pay tribute to the IMF and the brave men and women who
          risk life and freedom everyday to keep us safe. Some Agents of
          the IMF even continue their mission after having been betrayed
          by their own agency and country. We are in your eternal dept.

                  <p>
                  Ethan Matthew Hunt was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the
                  only child of Margaret Ethan and Nathan Hunt. Raised
                  on a dairy farm in Middle field, New York, he enlisted
                  in the Army right out of high school. Ethan enlisted
                  for the Infantry military occupational specialty and
                  decided that he would become an Army Ranger. After
                  graduating Basic, Advanced Individual, and Airborne
                  Training, Ethan was sent to the Ranger Indoctrination
                  Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the
                  3rd Battalion of 75th Ranger Regiment, under the
                  command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. He
                  then attended and passed Ranger School, where he
                  earned his Ranger Tab.  Ethan eventually fought in
                  combat during Operation Desert Storm.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  After four distinguished years in the Army, Ethan went
                  on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he
                  was a double major in Engineering and International
                  Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he
                  immediately sought employment with the Central
                  Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the
                  Agency, he had to go through background checks, take
                  the entrance exam, and go through a series of
                  interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the
                  entrance and psychological examinations, Ethan was
                  contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA
                  in a high-level position a few years before and he
                  believed Ethan would be perfect for a organization
                  outside of the Agency. In short order, he was
                  recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the
                  Impossible Mission Force.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Although he was initially only told that he would be
                  tasked with "unconventional black ops", Ethan
                  exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was
                  informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an
                  intensive operational training course to train him in
                  so-called "operational intelligence" or "trade-craft"
                  skills, including surveillance, clandestine
                  photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques.
                  He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical
                  high speed emergency driving, rappelling from
                  helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of
                  his military experience, Ethan excelled through
                  training.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Once he completed training, he was given the "cover
                  legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department
                  of Transportation and placed in a five person team
                  (called an "IM Force") as the team's point man. Led
                  by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job
                  was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical
                  intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and
                  neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a
                  trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence
                  organizations in that, once their orders have been
                  given, there are no required procedures for the
                  fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his
                  fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary
                  and success was all that matters. The downside was,
                  of course, obvious; if a team member was either
                  captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would
                  disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.

                  legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department
                  of Transportation and placed in a five person team
                  (called an "IM Force") as the team's point man. Led
                  by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job
                  was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical
                  intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and
                  neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a
                  trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence
                  organizations in that, once their orders have been
                  given, there are no required procedures for the
                  fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his
                  fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary
                  and success was all that matters. The downside was,
                  of course, obvious; if a team member was either
                  captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would
                  disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.

                  Ethan Matthew Hunt was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the
                  only child of Margaret Ethan and Nathan Hunt. Raised
                  on a dairy farm in Middle field, New York, he enlisted
                  in the Army right out of high school. Ethan enlisted
                  for the Infantry military occupational specialty and
                  decided that he would become an Army Ranger. After
                  graduating Basic, Advanced Individual, and Airborne
                  Training, Ethan was sent to the Ranger Indoctrination
                  Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the
                  3rd Battalion of 75th Ranger Regiment, under the
                  command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. He
                  then attended and passed Ranger School, where he
                  earned his Ranger Tab.  Ethan eventually fought in
                  combat during Operation Desert Storm.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  After four distinguished years in the Army, Ethan went
                  on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he
                  was a double major in Engineering and International
                  Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he
                  immediately sought employment with the Central
                  Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the
                  Agency, he had to go through background checks, take
                  the entrance exam, and go through a series of
                  interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the
                  entrance and psychological examinations, Ethan was
                  contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA
                  in a high-level position a few years before and he
                  believed Ethan would be perfect for a organization
                  outside of the Agency. In short order, he was
                  recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the
                  Impossible Mission Force.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Although he was initially only told that he would be
                  tasked with "unconventional black ops", Ethan
                  exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was
                  informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an
                  intensive operational training course to train him in
                  so-called "operational intelligence" or "trade-craft"
                  skills, including surveillance, clandestine
                  photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques.
                  He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical
                  high speed emergency driving, rappelling from
                  helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of
                  his military experience, Ethan excelled through
                  training.

                  Ethan Matthew Hunt was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the
                  only child of Margaret Ethan and Nathan Hunt. Raised
                  on a dairy farm in Middle field, New York, he enlisted
                  in the Army right out of high school. Ethan enlisted
                  for the Infantry military occupational specialty and
                  decided that he would become an Army Ranger. After
                  graduating Basic, Advanced Individual, and Airborne
                  Training, Ethan was sent to the Ranger Indoctrination
                  Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the
                  3rd Battalion of 75th Ranger Regiment, under the
                  command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. He
                  then attended and passed Ranger School, where he
                  earned his Ranger Tab.  Ethan eventually fought in
                  combat during Operation Desert Storm.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  After four distinguished years in the Army, Ethan went
                  on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he
                  was a double major in Engineering and International
                  Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he
                  immediately sought employment with the Central
                  Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the
                  Agency, he had to go through background checks, take
                  the entrance exam, and go through a series of
                  interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the
                  entrance and psychological examinations, Ethan was
                  contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA
                  in a high-level position a few years before and he
                  believed Ethan would be perfect for a organization
                  outside of the Agency. In short order, he was
                  recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the
                  Impossible Mission Force.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Although he was initially only told that he would be
                  tasked with "unconventional black ops", Ethan
                  exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was
                  informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an
                  intensive operational training course to train him in
                  so-called "operational intelligence" or "trade-craft"
                  skills, including surveillance, clandestine
                  photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques.
                  He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical
                  high speed emergency driving, rappelling from
                  helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of
                  his military experience, Ethan excelled through
                  training.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Once he completed training, he was given the "cover
                  legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department
                  of Transportation and placed in a five person team
                  (called an "IM Force") as the team's point man. Led
                  by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job
                  was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical
                  intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and
                  neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a
                  trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence
                  organizations in that, once their orders have been
                  given, there are no required procedures for the
                  fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his
                  fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary
                  and success was all that matters. The downside was,
                  of course, obvious; if a team member was either
                  captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would
                  disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.

                  Ethan Matthew Hunt was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the
                  only child of Margaret Ethan and Nathan Hunt. Raised
                  on a dairy farm in Middle field, New York, he enlisted
                  in the Army right out of high school. Ethan enlisted
                  for the Infantry military occupational specialty and
                  decided that he would become an Army Ranger. After
                  graduating Basic, Advanced Individual, and Airborne
                  Training, Ethan was sent to the Ranger Indoctrination
                  Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the
                  3rd Battalion of 75th Ranger Regiment, under the
                  command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. He
                  then attended and passed Ranger School, where he
                  earned his Ranger Tab.  Ethan eventually fought in
                  combat during Operation Desert Storm.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  After four distinguished years in the Army, Ethan went
                  on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he
                  was a double major in Engineering and International
                  Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he
                  immediately sought employment with the Central
                  Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the
                  Agency, he had to go through background checks, take
                  the entrance exam, and go through a series of
                  interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the
                  entrance and psychological examinations, Ethan was
                  contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA
                  in a high-level position a few years before and he
                  believed Ethan would be perfect for a organization
                  outside of the Agency. In short order, he was
                  recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the
                  Impossible Mission Force.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Although he was initially only told that he would be
                  tasked with "unconventional black ops", Ethan
                  exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was
                  informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an
                  intensive operational training course to train him in
                  so-called "operational intelligence" or "trade-craft"
                  skills, including surveillance, clandestine
                  photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques.
                  He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical
                  high speed emergency driving, rappelling from
                  helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of
                  his military experience, Ethan excelled through
                  training.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Once he completed training, he was given the "cover
                  legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department
                  of Transportation and placed in a five person team
                  (called an "IM Force") as the team's point man. Led
                  by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job
                  was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical
                  intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and
                  neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a
                  trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence
                  organizations in that, once their orders have been
                  given, there are no required procedures for the
                  fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his
                  fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary
                  and success was all that matters. The downside was,
                  of course, obvious; if a team member was either
                  captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would
                  disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.

                  on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he
                  was a double major in Engineering and International
                  Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he
                  immediately sought employment with the Central
                  Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the
                  Agency, he had to go through background checks, take
                  the entrance exam, and go through a series of
                  interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the
                  entrance and psychological examinations, Ethan was
                  contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA
                  in a high-level position a few years before and he
                  believed Ethan would be perfect for a organization
                  outside of the Agency. In short order, he was
                  recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the
                  Impossible Mission Force.

                  <p>
                  Although he was initially only told that he would be
                  tasked with "unconventional black ops", Ethan
                  exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was
                  informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an
                  intensive operational training course to train him in
                  so-called "operational intelligence" or "trade-craft"
                  skills, including surveillance, clandestine
                  photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques.
                  He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical
                  high speed emergency driving, rappelling from
                  helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of
                  his military experience, Ethan excelled through
                  training.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Once he completed training, he was given the "cover
                  legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department
                  of Transportation and placed in a five person team
                  (called an "IM Force") as the team's point man. Led
                  by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job
                  was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical
                  intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and
                  neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a
                  trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence
                  organizations in that, once their orders have been
                  given, there are no required procedures for the
                  fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his
                  fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary
                  and success was all that matters. The downside was,
                  of course, obvious; if a team member was either
                  captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would
                  disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.

                  Ethan Matthew Hunt was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the
                  only child of Margaret Ethan and Nathan Hunt. Raised
                  on a dairy farm in Middle field, New York, he enlisted
                  in the Army right out of high school. Ethan enlisted
                  for the Infantry military occupational specialty and
                  decided that he would become an Army Ranger. After
                  graduating Basic, Advanced Individual, and Airborne
                  Training, Ethan was sent to the Ranger Indoctrination
                  Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the
                  3rd Battalion of 75th Ranger Regiment, under the
                  command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. He
                  then attended and passed Ranger School, where he
                  earned his Ranger Tab.  Ethan eventually fought in
                  combat during Operation Desert Storm.

                  Ethan Matthew Hunt was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the
                  only child of Margaret Ethan and Nathan Hunt. Raised
                  on a dairy farm in Middle field, New York, he enlisted
                  in the Army right out of high school. Ethan enlisted
                  for the Infantry military occupational specialty and
                  decided that he would become an Army Ranger. After
                  graduating Basic, Advanced Individual, and Airborne
                  Training, Ethan was sent to the Ranger Indoctrination
                  Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the
                  3rd Battalion of 75th Ranger Regiment, under the
                  command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. He
                  then attended and passed Ranger School, where he
                  earned his Ranger Tab.  Ethan eventually fought in
                  combat during Operation Desert Storm.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  After four distinguished years in the Army, Ethan went
                  on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he
                  was a double major in Engineering and International
                  Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he
                  immediately sought employment with the Central
                  Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the
                  Agency, he had to go through background checks, take
                  the entrance exam, and go through a series of
                  interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the
                  entrance and psychological examinations, Ethan was
                  contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA
                  in a high-level position a few years before and he
                  believed Ethan would be perfect for a organization
                  outside of the Agency. In short order, he was
                  recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the
                  Impossible Mission Force.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Although he was initially only told that he would be
                  tasked with "unconventional black ops", Ethan
                  exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was
                  informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an
                  intensive operational training course to train him in
                  so-called "operational intelligence" or "trade-craft"
                  skills, including surveillance, clandestine
                  photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques.
                  He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical
                  high speed emergency driving, rappelling from
                  helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of
                  his military experience, Ethan excelled through
                  training.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Once he completed training, he was given the "cover
                  legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department
                  of Transportation and placed in a five person team
                  (called an "IM Force") as the team's point man. Led
                  by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job
                  was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical
                  intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and
                  neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a
                  trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence
                  organizations in that, once their orders have been
                  given, there are no required procedures for the
                  fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his
                  fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary
                  and success was all that matters. The downside was,
                  of course, obvious; if a team member was either
                  captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would
                  disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.

                  Once he completed training, he was given the "cover
                  legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department
                  of Transportation and placed in a five person team
                  (called an "IM Force") as the team's point man. Led
                  by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job
                  was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical
                  intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and
                  neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a
                  trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence
                  organizations in that, once their orders have been
                  given, there are no required procedures for the
                  fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his
                  fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary
                  and success was all that matters. The downside was,
                  of course, obvious; if a team member was either
                  captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would
                  disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.

                  by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job
                  was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical
                  intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and
                  neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a
                  trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence
                  organizations in that, once their orders have been
                  given, there are no required procedures for the
                  fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his
                  fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary
                  and success was all that matters. The downside was,
                  of course, obvious; if a team member was either
                  captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would
                  disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.

                  Ethan Matthew Hunt was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the
                  only child of Margaret Ethan and Nathan Hunt. Raised
                  on a dairy farm in Middle field, New York, he enlisted
                  in the Army right out of high school. Ethan enlisted
                  for the Infantry military occupational specialty and
                  decided that he would become an Army Ranger. After
                  graduating Basic, Advanced Individual, and Airborne
                  Training, Ethan was sent to the Ranger Indoctrination
                  Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the
                  3rd Battalion of 75th Ranger Regiment, under the
                  command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. He
                  then attended and passed Ranger School, where he
                  earned his Ranger Tab.  Ethan eventually fought in
                  combat during Operation Desert Storm.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  After four distinguished years in the Army, Ethan went
                  on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he
                  was a double major in Engineering and International
                  Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he
                  immediately sought employment with the Central
                  Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the
                  Agency, he had to go through background checks, take
                  the entrance exam, and go through a series of
                  interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the
                  entrance and psychological examinations, Ethan was
                  contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA
                  in a high-level position a few years before and he
                  believed Ethan would be perfect for a organization
                  outside of the Agency. In short order, he was
                  recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the
                  Impossible Mission Force.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Although he was initially only told that he would be
                  tasked with "unconventional black ops", Ethan
                  exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was
                  informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an
                  intensive operational training course to train him in
                  so-called "operational intelligence" or "trade-craft"
                  skills, including surveillance, clandestine
                  photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques.
                  He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical
                  high speed emergency driving, rappelling from
                  helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of
                  his military experience, Ethan excelled through
                  training.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Once he completed training, he was given the "cover
                  legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department
                  of Transportation and placed in a five person team
