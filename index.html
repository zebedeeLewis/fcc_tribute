Raised on a dairy farm in Middle field, New York, he enlisted in the Army right out of high school. Ethan enlisted for the Infantry military occupational specialty and decided that he would become an Army Ranger. After graduating Basic, Advanced Individual, and Airborne Training, Ethan was sent to the Ranger Indoctrination Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the 3rd Battalion of 75th Ranger Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. He then attended and passed Ranger School, where he earned his Ranger Tab. Ethan eventually fought in combat during Operation Desert Storm.</p><p> After four distinguished years in the Army, Ethan went on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a double major in Engineering and International Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he immediately sought employment with the Central Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the Agency, he had to go through background checks, take the entrance exam, and go through a series of interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the entrance and psychological examinations, Ethan was contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA in a high-level position a few years before and he believed Ethan would be perfect for a organization outside of the Agency. In short order, he was recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the Impossible Mission Force.</p><p> Although he was initially only told that he would be tasked with "unconventional black ops", Ethan exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an intensive operational training course to train him in so-called "operational intelligence" or "trade-craft" skills, including surveillance, clandestine photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques. He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical high speed emergency driving, rappelling from helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of his military experience, Ethan excelled through training.</p><p> Once he completed training, he was given the "cover legend" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department of Transportation and placed in a five person team (called an "IM Force") as the team's point man. Led by Senior Agent James "Jim" Phelps, the team's job was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence organizations in that, once their orders have been given, there are no required procedures for the fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary and success was all that matters. The downside was, of course, obvious; if a team member was either captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.</p><cite> <a href="http://missionimpossible.wikia.com/wiki/Ethan_Hunt" target="_blank">wiki</a></cite></blockquote><label class="details__ctrl--toggle-show-more" for="details--ethan__state--show-more"> </label></div> </section><input name="operators-profile__details__state-group--show-more" id="profile--luther__state--visibility" class="profile__state--visibility" type="radio"/> <section id="profile--luther" class="profile"> <figure class="profile__banner"> <img class="responsive-img profile-img" src="./img/luther-stickell.jpg" alt="" /> <figcaption class="profile-caption"><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">Name: </span> <span class="field__value">Luther Stickell</span></div><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">Status: </span> <span class="field__value">Active</span></div><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">Nationality: </span> <span class="field__value">American</span></div><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">DOB: </span> <span class="field__value">15/09/90</span></div> </figcaption> </figure><div class="profile__content"><h3>Luther Stickell</h3> <input type="checkbox" id="details--luther__state--show-more" class="details__state--show-more" /><blockquote class="details"><p> Luther John Stickell joined the Impossible Mission Force (I.M.F.) at an unknown time (knowingly before Hunt) and he was the agency's computer specialist. Luther would later become an disavowed agent and went into the shadows against his former employers.</p><p> After Ethan Hunt learned there was a mole in the IMF and the N.O.C list was faked, he needed a team of operatives off the grid to clear his name. Hunt enlisted disavowed agents Luther and pilot Franz Krieger alongside Jim Phelps' wife Claire.</p><p> Stickell is chosen as "Cyber-Ops" for his reputation as a well-known hacker and phreaking. Reluctant at first, Luther is baited into the hack when Ethan played to Stickell's ego, selling the job proposal as "The Mount Everest of hacks". Posing as a team of firefighters putting out a small blaze within the building, the rogue IMF team breaches the Central Intelligence Agency and infiltrates the main computer mainframe via a remote computer terminal at the CIA Headquarters at Langley, Virginia. In order to gain access to the floor with the N.O.C List, Luther hacks into the building's computer-controlled electrical system, triggering the fire alarm on that floor.</p><cite> <a href="http://missionimpossible.wikia.com/wiki/Luther_Stickell" target="_blank">wiki</a></cite></blockquote><label class="details__ctrl--toggle-show-more" for="details--luther__state--show-more"> </label></div> </section><input name="operators-profile__details__state-group--show-more" id="profile--benji__state--visibility" class="profile__state--visibility" type="radio"/> <section id="profile--benji" class="profile"> <figure class="profile__banner"> <img class="responsive-img profile-img" src="./img/benji-dunn.jpg" alt="" /> <figcaption class="profile-caption"><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">Name: </span> <span class="field__value">Benji Dunn</span></div><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">Status: </span> <span class="field__value">Active</span></div><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">Nationality: </span> <span class="field__value">American</span></div><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">DOB: </span> <span class="field__value">15/09/90</span></div> </figcaption> </figure><div class="profile__content"><h3>Benji Dunn</h3> <input type="checkbox" id="details--benji__state--show-more" class="details__state--show-more" /><blockquote class="details"><p> Benji, who was once a technician, aided Ethan Hunt during the events of his wife, Julia Meade's kidnapping.

Following the hearing, Hunley questioned William Brandt on the whereabouts of Ethan Hunt. Brandt claimed ignorance and stated that Hunt was chasing a lead on the Syndicate. However, Hunley stated that the CIA hadn't found proof of the Syndicate's existence, believing it to be a fantasy created by Ethan to justify the IMF's existence. Deeming Ethan to be dangerous, Hunley organized a manhunt for Ethan, only for the man to elude the CIA for six months. Later, he interrogates Benji Dunn about Ethan's whereabouts, but doesn't get any info.</p><p> Subsequently, Dunn goes to Vienna, where the Austrian chancellor is killed by a car bomb. Hunley believed Hunt and Dunn to be responsible and authorized the CIA to shoot them on sight. After some time, Hunley is called by Brandt, claiming that he wants to alert him of a plot against the British Prime Minister. Believing Ethan was targeting him, Hunley went to meet directly with the Prime Minister and MI6 Chief Atlee. When he tells the Prime Minister of Hunt's pursuit of the Syndicate and his mission to unlock a digital red box that only he has access to, the Prime Minister expresses familiarity. He reveals that the Syndicate was a classified proposed project to recruit foreign operatives to perform missions without oversight and realizes that Atlee created the Syndicate without his approval.</p><cite> <a href="http://missionimpossible.wikia.com/wiki/Alan_Hunley" target="_blank">wiki</a></cite></blockquote><label class="details__ctrl--toggle-show-more"

Hendricks became the Professor of Physics at Stockholm University where he specialized in the minutiae of the nuclear endgame theory. He was regarded as a genius, with an IQ of 190. Despite this, he was forced to resign by the university due to his outlandish theories and claims of insanity. Following this, Hendricks was affiliated with the Russian Central Command during the Cold War, wherein his job was to "predict the unthinkable". After twenty years in his role as a nuclear strategist, Hendricks came up with the concept of nuclear war in the place of natural order after following the examples of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hendricks then worked in the Kremlin as a nuclear strategist, wherein he formulated a plan to steal a briefcase with nuclear launch codes to facilitate his concept of world destruction.</p><p> Hendricks' plan was to ignite a nuclear conflict between Russia and the United States. In order to facilitate this, Hendricks arranged the destruction of the Kremlin in Moscow in order to steal a nuclear launch control-device while ultimately placing the blame on the Impossible Mission Force. Hendricks also later acquires the launch codes for the missile from Sabine Moreau, whilst posing as his right-hand man Marius Wistrom. His strategy for this conflict was to ignite a global nuclear exchange and thus eliminate most of the world's population. With most of the world's people wiped out (and presumably their old conflicts and hatreds along with them), a new era of "peace" could be ushered in. Hendricks used the code name; Cobalt, to prevent his true identity from surfacing. After officially being disavowed because of the Kremlin bombing, Ethan Hunt and his team consisting of agents Jane Carter, Benji Dunn and Chief Analyst, William Brandt, are tasked with stopping Hendricks and bringing his conspiracy to light, or be hunted down as terrorists responsible for the bombing. Extremely resourceful, Hendricks made use of latex masks to fool Hunt and his team into believing that they were dealing with his right-hand man, eventually escaped with the case that contains Russian nuclear launch codes.</p><cite> <a href="http://missionimpossible.wikia.com/wiki/Kurt_Hendricks" target="_blank">wiki</a></cite></blockquote><label class="details__ctrl--toggle-show-more" for="details--kurt__state--show-more"> </label></div> </section><input name="hvt-profile__details__state-group--show-more" id="profile--owen__state--visibility" class="profile__state--visibility" type="radio"/> <section id="profile--owen" class="profile"> <figure class="profile__banner"> <img class="responsive-img profile-img" src="./img/owen-davian.jpg" alt="" /> <figcaption class="profile-caption"><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">Name: </span> <span class="field__value">Owen Davian</span></div><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">Status: </span> <span class="field__value">Dead</span></div><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">Nationality: </span> <span class="field__value">American</span></div><div class="field"> <span class="field__name">DOB: </span> <span class="field__value">15/09/90</span></div> </figcaption> </figure><div class="profile__content"><h3>owen davian</h3> <input type="checkbox" id="details--owen__state--show-more" class="details__state--show-more" /><blockquote class="details"><p> In 2006, Davian's illegal activities, including arms trafficking, prompted IMF agent Lindsey Farris to follow him.

We used to call him - you know, well, I won't tell you what we used to call him, but he taught biomolecular kinetics and cellular dynamics. And he used to sort of scare the underclassmen with this story about how the world would eventually be eviscerated by technology. You see, it was inevitable that a compound would be created which he referred to as the 'Anti-God'. It was like an **accelerated mutator or sort of, you know, like a, an unstoppable force of destructive power, that would just lay waste to everything** - to buildings and parks and streets and children and ice cream parlors, you know?
